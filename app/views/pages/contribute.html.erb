      <p>The Robinson Map Library collects, curates and archives geospatial data for the state of Wisconsin. Additional contributions of geographic content are always welcome!  We are interested in knowing about existing data that should be included in the geoportal.  If you publish an Open Data site and are interested in having your content discoverable via GeoData@Wisconsin, please contact us with the appropriate URL.</p>

      <p>Contact <a href="mailto:jmartindale@wisc.edu">Jaime Martindale</a> with inquiries or suggestions for data, maps, or other resources that may be considered for inclusion in GeoData@Wisconsin.</p>
